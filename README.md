Practicing Creating an API using ASP.NET Core Web API .NET 8.0

Open the Solution file in Visual Studio, or open the folder in Visual Studio Code

Move to "APIPractice1\api", where the .csproj is and "dotnet watch run" to run the program

The Nuget packages themselves are not included in the repository, only references to those packages are stored in the *.csproj file.
When running a dotnet command or  on opening the project in Visual Studio, NuGet will automatically download the required packages from the NuGet repository and cache them locally
